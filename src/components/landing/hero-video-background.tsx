/**
 * Hero background — autoplaying looping video with a static image fallback.
 *
 * The `<video>` is sourced from the bundled `/hero.mp4` asset (downloaded
 * once from the original `typefive.b-cdn.net` CDN and committed to the repo
 * so we have no runtime external dependency). The previous external CDN URL
 * was silently blocked by the project CSP (`media-src 'self' blob:`), which
 * is why the hero looked empty. Bundling the file locally means it is
 * served from `'self'` (always CSP-allowed) and is also available offline.
 *
 * Inside the `<video>` element we keep a fallback `<img>` using the
 * existing `public/hero-bg.png` — browsers render this automatically if
 * the `<source>` fails to load or if the user agent doesn't support
 * `<video>` (e.g., very old browsers / some accessibility tools).
 *
 * AUTOPLAY + THE REACT `muted` BUG (facebook/react#10389):
 * React does NOT reliably transfer the JSX `muted` attribute to the
 * `HTMLMediaElement.muted` DOM property at mount time. On Safari/iOS this
 * means autoplay silently fails (browsers block autoplay of unmuted media
 * without a user gesture). The fix is to keep the `muted` JSX attribute for
 * documentation, AND ALSO set `videoRef.current.muted = true` inside a
 * `useEffect`, then explicitly call `videoRef.current.play()` and swallow
 * the rejection if the browser still blocks it (the <img> fallback then
 * covers the visual gap).
 *
 * Autoplay attributes (`autoPlay muted playsInline`) are required for
 * iOS Safari to start playback without a user gesture. `loop` makes the
 * clip run endlessly in the background; `preload="auto"` hints the browser
 * to fetch it immediately. The clip is purely decorative so it is marked
 * `aria-hidden="true"`; the hero text in the foreground is the real
 * content.
 *
 * The parallax motion (y/opacity transforms) + gradient overlays are
 * preserved from the original implementation. The previous play/pause
 * toggle button has been intentionally removed — autoplay background video
 * shouldn't have interactive controls, and a paused background video
 * defeats its purpose.
 *
 * Component name kept as `HeroVideoBackground` to avoid touching the
 * parent import graph (`landing-page-client.tsx`).
